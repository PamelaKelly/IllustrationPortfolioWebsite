>Really interested in using CSS3 animations to enhance the focus on visuals on my site. 
>I'm also really interested in making a site that supports multiple browsers so I looked at using -webkit and @keyframes to do this for my CSS3 animation on the home page. Had some errors with this in the validator - detailed below. 
>I looked at other image manipulation features in CSS3 mentioned above like <figure> and <polaroid>. 


Notes on validation:
I did get some errors regarding @-webkit-keyframe and -webkit-animation-name, in my CSS when I validated it with W3C. However I looked up the error and found out that it was thrown because the specifications for W3C don't ackknowledge vendor-specific prefixes, but that it should be ok to leave it as is.
