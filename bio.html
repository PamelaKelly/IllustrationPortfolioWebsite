            <h1>Embroidered Textile Designer & Illustration, Dublin - Ireland.</h1>
            <div class="div-column">My background is in art & design. I specialised in Embroidered Textile Design at the National College of Art and Design. I produced an extensive body of work grounded in advanced drawing skills. This body of illustration work was developed into a range of textile artworks for the NCAD Degree Show 2013. My thesis entitled 'The Role of the Hand and the Machine in Traditional & Contemporary Textile Practice' explored the advantages and disadvantages of working with one's hands and the role of machinery and technology within craft and design industries. The final Chapter is a case study exploring these issues in specific relation to embroidery in Western India. This was fuelled and informed by a research trip to Gujarat, India, funded by the Thomas Dammann Junior Memorial Trust. My professional career slowly moved towards design positions that overlapped with branding and digital marketing. This overlap exposed me to areas such as web design and development. My interest in technology grew and after some experimenting with coding at home, I decided to push my career further in that direction by taking this Conversion Masters at UCD.</div>
